Here will be all labs for special sections of computational math.

## LongLibrary

Library for unsigned long numbers any length (by default 2048 bits in binary) in 2^32 number system.  
Supports basic operations: 
- Adding two LongInt's (+);
- Subtracting two LongInt's (-);
- Multiplication of LongInt and regular uint(not commutative) (LongInt * uint);
- Multi-bit multiplication of two LongInt's (LongInt * LongInt);
- Division two LongInt's (/);
- Modulus one number by another (%);
- Bit shifts left and right (<<, >>), which represents multiplying or division by 2^32;
- The power of one LongInt to another LongInt (.Pow)
